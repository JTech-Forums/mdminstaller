Last Updated: September 4, 2025

JTech MDM Installer lets you load management apps onto Android devices through WebUSB. To make this work we read basic device data such as USB identifiers, firmware details and installation logs. We also collect technical information including your browser type, operating system, IP address and timestamps. Usage data is stored so we can improve compatibility, diagnose errors and meet legal obligations.

We do not sell or rent your information. We may share limited data with trusted service providers or when required by law.

You should only use this tool on devices you are authorized to manage. Installing an MDM can change device behavior and is done at your own risk. The software is provided "as is" without any warranties.

This policy may change. Continued use of the installer after updates means you accept the revised policy.
